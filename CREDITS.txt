Most of the code in this package was written by myself (Daniel Zerbino).

However, some code was reused with kind permission from:
- John-Mark Gurney, for his Fibonacci heap implementation 
(http://resnet.uoregon.edu/~gurney_j/jmpc/fib.html)
- Guy Slater, for his memory management routines 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~guy/exonerate/) 
- Ewan Birney, for his hashing function
(ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/wise2/)

Also this package uses and includes the zlib library developped by Jean-Loup
Gailly and Mark Adler - more details in the zlib README file.

To this package I also bundled some third-party analysis scripts for Velvet: 
- Paul Harrison produced a script to convert a Velvet Graph file into a
  GraphViz .dot file, which GraphViz can then turn into pretty images.
- Simon Gladman wrote two scripts to quickly examine .afg files. The first one
  allows the user to break down the assembly file into contig files, and the
  second to view, within an ASCII terminal, the alignment of reads at a given
  position in a contig. 

Many thanks to: 
- Darren Platt for his very thorough debugging.
- Andrew Fernandes and Greg Gloor for advice on Mac compilation.
- Craig Cummings and Vrunda Sheth for their work on the colorspace version of
  Velvet.
